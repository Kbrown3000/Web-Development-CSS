Using CSS for basic Coding

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Basically, CSS is a language that manages the design and presentation of web pages 
the way things look. It works together with HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, which handles the content of web pages.
With CSS you can create rules to tell your website how you want it to display information and you can keep the commands 
for the style stuff like fonts, colors, and so on separate from the commands for the content.

They’re called “cascading” because you can have multiple style sheets, with one style sheet inheriting properties (or “cascading”)
from others. For a lot of people a plain old blog template is good enough. It’s only when you want to start customizing the look 
of a site that you need to delve into CSS.

There are three kinds of CSS style sheets: external, internal, and inline.External styles control how things look across many 
pages on a website.

1)Internal styles control the look of just one page.
2)Inline styles control just one element of a single page, even just a single word.
3)External styles control how things look across many pages on a website.

You can use multiple style sheets, and they will know how to defer to one another. Basically, inline overrides internal, and
internal overrides external. I have created this CSS repository to improve my skills and to share it with others as needed in 
accordance with the following copyright laws in the LICENCSE text. Its best to rely mostly on external styles,and avoiding the 
one-off stuff as much as possible.You write out CSS commands and create a style sheet using a text editor. Then you link that
style sheet to your HTML and your site will now obey the rules you’ve set forth in the CSS style sheet.There’s a lot more
to CSS than what can be covered in this readme file. However certain syntax are followed in creating vidve CSS based programs.
